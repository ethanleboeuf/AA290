%% Use Case for Problem Set 1
% This use case will only be used for this week as I am setting up the sim
% and working through the various needs. It will have 3-DOF of freedom and
% two spacecrafts that are just propogated through time


%% Initialize Buses
OES_init_bus;
CON = Simulink.Bus.createMATLABStruct(
%% Spacecraft ICs
sats.NXS = NXS_ic();
sats.astro = astro_ic(sats.NXS, CON);

%% Sim Setup
SimEndTime = 4000;
TimeStep = 0.5;
